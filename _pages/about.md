Hi, my name is Parisa. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Operations Management and Statistics at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto (UofT). Before joining Rotman, I completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering at Sharif University of Technology (SUT). My primary research interests include Dynamic Programming and Combinatorial Optimization.

I’m the _Vice President of Communications for the [University of Toronto Operations Research Group (UTORG)](https://org.mie.utoronto.ca/)_. If you’d like to give a talk at one of our events, feel free to reach out.
