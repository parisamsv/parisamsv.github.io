Hi, my name is Parisa. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Operations Management and Statistics at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. Before joining Rotman, I completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). 

My primary research interests include Dynamic Programming and Combinatorial Optimization.
